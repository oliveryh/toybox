# GitHub Repo Stats

Produces a table of python repositories and if they have `pyproject.toml` files present.

## Set Up

1. Download a personal github token and add it to a `.env` file as the key `GITHUB_TOKEN`
2. Run the main script

## Future Use

This could be extended to do further reporting on the state of the github repositories I own.
